# Q&A
## What's working?
Everything listed in the pdf is working
## Why X and not Y?
(PreferenceScreen, Themes, Attributes, different layouts for different screens etc)<br/>
Well, in a project this small I decided not to spend too much time preparing the structure of the project, but in a bigger projects that's make sense to spend more time preparing project before the actual work
## On what devices app was tested?
App was tested on a tablet and android emulator running Nexus 5X API 26. <br\>
No problems detected on these devices.
